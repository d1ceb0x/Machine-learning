Hey, I'm a 17 year old student who is interested in Machine learning and Data science, and I also love astronomy.

On this project, I decided to do some applied science on the GAIA stellar dataset, from the European Space Agency. 

My goal is to try to optimise the way we search and classify for new stars, by "predicting" their stellar properties, instead of observing them, based on similar data, using various ML algorithms

I am going to train a few models, analyse their loss functions (and maybe hypertune them if needed), and then apply statistical tests (like the Chi squared test and pearsons correlation test), to measure the accuracy of the outputs, and to confirm my hypothesis (that the predicted data matches the expected data).

I will be uploading all my models here, and their analyses here. Feel free to contact me at: inusyd@gmail.com, if you have any questions! 

Thanks for supporting me!

P.S: Mostly everything will be done using python and Jupyter notebook. 

GAIA data for machine learning projects was obtained from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solorzano/257k-gaia-dr2-stars/data
